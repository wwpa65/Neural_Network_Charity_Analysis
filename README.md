# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis


## Overview

In this work, Nural Network Modeling (Deep Learning) was used to help a foundation (Alphabet Soup) to perform loan risk assessment for predicting where to make investments on their applicants using data (in a a CSV) containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization. The data were preprocessed, and split into training and test dataset. The initial neural network models were assesed, and then were optimized with the aim to achieve > 75% accuracy. 

**Tools:**
